# Education
In short, I'm about to be pursuing a major in aerospace engineering at Oklahoma State University. But currently, I'm concurrently enrolled at Cashion High School and Redlands Community College.

## High School
### Extracurriculars
  - Business Professionals of America, 2-year chapter president 
    - 2-time national competitor, Funds. of Linux

    - Ambassador (national) Torch Award Recipient
  - National Honor Society, chapter president
    - 2 community service hours must be completed each semester to retain membership; I have been in the group for 2 years now
  - HS Esports Team, founder and captain

    - Held multiple leadership roles and I've thrived in the learning environment
    - I absolutely *love* playing the marimba! [You can watch a piece](https://youtu.be/pwYNXiK0-gs?si=IksCaFbGBaWe-wWd) that my friend Dagon and I played for both a contest and an audience of hundreds. (I am the one playing four mallets at once)

### Accolades
- ACT: 35
- PSAT: 1430
- GPA: 4.05 (4.0 Unweighted)

## College
### Redlands CC
- Concurrently enrolled and have taken 9 hours worth of mostly history credits
- Enrolled in one more class during my senior year, and then I'm done with concurrent college.

### Oklahoma State University
- I will major in Aerospace Engineering with an option (or minor) in American Sign Language
- A graduate degree is in my mind, but it's most likely going to be out-of-state... something like Central Florida.
